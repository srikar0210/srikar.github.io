# KIF Social Media Wiki
The idea behind creating this Wiki to bring the exisitng processes behind all the social media activities at one place so that anyone at any given time can pick up tasks and be in a position to execute them. 

## Work flow for IG quotes
The main idea on this content creation is bring Guruji's longer FB posts (old and new as he pens down) in to IG posts using a standard template that has been already established.

- First a old exisitng post on Facebook need to be selected from here [Google Doc Old FB Posts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Mw4tf2YfnHDgrIGrHYYBXhd5mOV9fiJG/edit).
  - NOTE: The text that is marked <span style="color:red">RED</span> has already been used for posting on IG.
  - Newer FB posts can also be used as Guruji's pens them down and shared the link in the main sadhaka group.

- Once the post is selected, it needs to be used in the template through Canva software. [Canva](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGbuGqdryo/iPflTrBEhxkqhGMomObJyA/edit?ui=eyJEIjp7IlAiOnsiQiI6ZmFsc2V9fX0).
    - NOTE: The font should be **Hermattan** and font size should be around **40 to 44**. This provides uniformity on IG.
 
- If the post is small, it could be made consice and made into **one** IG post, otherwise generally Guruji's FB post can be used to create atleast **3 to 4** IG posts.

- Consecutive IG posts should have a different template with Guruji's different picture. All of Guruji's picture after his approval will be placed here [Link text](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Tr2ve8fCdnfX5WkWbufCHV0opnoLYD2X?usp=share_link) for anyone to donwload and use it in the template.

- **IMP**: Once the content is selected, picture is selected, it should be made sure they are alligned with **Centre alligning** and made sure there is padding in all directions.

- Once all the steps are taken care of and the post is satisfactorily made, it can be shared in the Social Media Group for posting.
